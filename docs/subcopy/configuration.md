## TeraCopy Location

After you complete the TeraCopy installation, launch the SubCopy application. When SubCopy starts, the application looks for the TeraCopy application executable in the default installation location and automatically configures the application to use it. 

If you installed TeraCopy in a different location, the application automatically opens the application **Settings** dialog so you can select the location for the TeraCopy executable.

## Directory Settings

## Managing Projects

The application stores the copy configuration in external project files, files with a `scpy` extension.
 
Once you have the application's copy configuration set, you must save the project. From the **File** menu, select **Save**. The application prompts you to save the project in the system's My Documents folder.

Like other Windows applications, Subdirectory Copy allows you to:

+ Save an existing Project under a new name using the **Save As** menu item.
+ Open an existing Project using the **Open** menu item.
+ Create a new Project using the **New** menu item.

The application's File menu offers an option called **Recent** which displays the list of the previous 5 projects opened in the application.
