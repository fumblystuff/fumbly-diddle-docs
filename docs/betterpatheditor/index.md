# Better Path Editor

Microsoft Windows ships with a capable Path Editor, offering users options for adding, editing, and deleting path entries. Recent enhancements to the application allows users to move entries up and down within the *User* or *System* Path sections plus identifies invalid path entries.

For the everyday Windows user, this is probably enough, but if you're a heavy Windows user or a Windows app developer, you probably need more capabilities to keep your Windows Path pruned, trimmed, and ready to work.

The free **Better Path Editor** provides all of the capabilities of the Path Editor built into Microsoft Windows, but then adds a lot more. Better Path Editor allows you to:

+ Move Path entries to the Top or Bottom of a Path section (User or System Path entries).
+ Move multiple Path entries within a Path section simultaneously.
+ Move one or more Path entries between Path sections.
+ Copy all of the path entries for one of the Path sections to the Windows clipboard.
+ Copy all of the path entries for both Path sections to the Windows clipboard.
+ Generate reports of your system Path entries in Text or Markdown format.
+ Perform actions on the Path entries.

Supported Actions include:

+ Add or remove trailing delimiters (backslash) to/from all Path entries
+ Delete duplicate entries
+ Delete invalid entries
+ Convert all drive letters to lower or upper case
+ Sort Path entries in drive order (alphabetical)

Here's the application's main interface:
